  Data sparsity:              ~99% (expected for single-cell data)

QUALITY METRICS BY CATEGORY:
  
  High quality (>8,000 UMIs/cell):        68 samples (43.3%)

================================================================================
SAMPLES REQUIRING ATTENTION
================================================================================

LOW MAPPING RATE (<70%):
  SRR11272046: 37.69% (61.59% unmapped) - still detected 83 cells
  SRR11272078: 61.26%
  SRR11272070: 62.78%
  SRR11272042: 65.22%
  SRR11272033: 67.22%
  SRR11272037: 68.77%

LOW CELL COUNT (<70 cells):
  SRR11272006: 60 cells (but 11.8M reads, 83% mapping)
  
INTERPRETATION:
  • Even SRR11272046 (worst mapping) detected 83 cells successfully
  • Low mapping may indicate: contamination, adapter issues, or RNA quality
  • Despite low mapping, cell detection and UMI counts are reasonable
  • Recommend: Keep all samples, but flag low-mapping ones for downstream QC

PIPELINE VALIDATION
================================================================================

✓ ALIGNMENT SUCCESS:

  • All BAMs have CB (cell barcode) and UB (UMI) tags
  • Average 79.8% mapping rate (excellent for TE quantification)
  • Multi-mapping (12.85%) indicates TEs properly included

✓ CELL BARCODE ASSIGNMENT:

  • 91 samples (58%) detected all 84 expected cells
  • 66 samples (42%) detected 60-83 cells (likely biological/technical variation)

✓ UMI DEDUPLICATION:
  • Average 7,426 UMIs/cell across 12,942 cells
  • Total 96.3M UMIs from 2.86B reads (3.4% UMI efficiency)
  • Appropriate for pooled protocol with 84 cells/sample

✓ FEATURE QUANTIFICATION:
  • 76,393 features (genes + TEs) quantified per cell
  • Average 511 features detected per cell
  • 99% sparsity is expected for scRNA-seq data

================================================================================
DOWNSTREAM RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

DATA QUALITY FILTERING:
  1. Filter cells: Keep cells with >200 features and >500 UMIs
  2. Filter features: Keep features detected in ≥3 cells
  3. Flag samples: Consider removing/flagging SRR11272046 (37.69% mapping)

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Merge all 157 scTE CSV files into single matrix
  2. Perform standard scRNA-seq QC (Seurat/Scanpy):
     - Doublet detection
     - Mitochondrial percentage filtering
     - Cell cycle scoring
  3. Normalize data (TPM/CPM or SCTransform)
  4. Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)
  5. Clustering and cell type identification
  6. Differential TE expression analysis

TE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
  1. Separate genes vs TEs in expression matrix
  2. Analyze TE families (LINE, SINE, LTR, DNA transposons)
  3. Calculate TE expression per cell type
  4. Identify cell-type-specific TE activation
  5. Correlate TE expression with nearby genes

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✓ PIPELINE SUCCESS: All 157 samples successfully processed
✓ DATA QUALITY: 79.8% mapping, 7,426 UMIs/cell, 511 features/cell
✓ CELL RECOVERY: 98.1% detection (12,942 of 13,188 expected cells)
✓ READY FOR ANALYSIS: Data is high quality and ready for downstream analysis

The "sparse" appearance is NORMAL for single-cell data - each cell expresses
only ~0.67% of available features (511 out of 76,393), which is typical for
scRNA-seq with shallow per-cell coverage in pooled protocols.
