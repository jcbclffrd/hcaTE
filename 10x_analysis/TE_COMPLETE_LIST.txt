## Filtering for Differential Expression
Out of 14,815 total TEs:
  - 1,847 passed filtering (≥10 cells, ≥3 counts)
  - 238 were significantly different between AD and MCI (FDR < 0.05)
  - 12,968 were excluded due to low expression

## Most Important TE Families for AD Research

### L1 Elements (Most studied)
Active in human genome, linked to:
  - Somatic mosaicism in brain
  - Neurodegeneration
  - Age-related accumulation
  - Tau-mediated activation in AD

### Alu Elements (Most abundant)
  - ~1 million copies in human genome
  - Can cause RNA toxicity
  - Involved in inflammation
  - Increased in AD brains

### SVA Elements (Young, active)
  - Human-specific
  - Polymorphic (variable between individuals)
  - Can disrupt genes
  - Fewer than 3,000 copies

### ERV/LTR Elements (Ancient retroviruses)
  - Remnants of viral infections
  - Most are silenced
  - Can be reactivated under stress
  - Linked to innate immunity
